`pretty-functional` is a collection of chapters and exercises designed to help you become more proficient in functional programming (FP) in JavaScript/TypeScript.  It is _not_ an authoritative guide on FP practices or theory, though we do have to introduce enough of those ideas so that your progression makes sense.

_Note to the reader: if something doesn't make sense, I'm flat out wrong, or something is hard to read... I have no editor, save you.  Feel free to open issues or submit a pull request with corrections or suggestions._

That said, the [introduction](/chapters/introduction/introduction.md) is probably the best place to start.
